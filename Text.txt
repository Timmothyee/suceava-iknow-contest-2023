decade that the field has made significant progress and started to have a significant impact on society 
and the economy. In 2011, IBM's Watson computer famously defeated human champions in the game 
show Jeopardy!, demonstrating the potential of AI to process large amounts of data and make complex 
decisions. In 2012, Google's deep neural network learned to recognize cats in images on its own, 
without being explicitly programmed to do so, showcasing the potential of machine learning. In 2016, 
AlphaGo, an AI system developed by Google's DeepMind, defeated the world champion in the board 
game Go, which had been considered a particularly difficult challenge for AI due to its complexity and 
the large number of possible moves. This achievement marked a significant milestone in the 
development of AI and demonstrated its potential to solve complex problems in a wide range of fields. 
In 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced in the European Union, setting 
new standards for data protection and privacy in the digital age. This marked an important step towards 
ensuring that the development and use of AI is aligned with ethical and legal principles, and protects the 
rights and interests of individuals. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the potential of AI to 
assist in crisis response efforts. AI has been used to track the spread of the virus, analyze data to identify 
patterns and potential treatments, and develop predictive models to help inform decision-making. 
Looking ahead, it is clear that AI will continue to have a significant impact on society and the economy in 
the coming years. It will be important for stakeholders to work together to ensure that AI is developed 
and used in a way that promotes transparency, accountability, privacy, equity, and inclusivity, while also 
recognizing the tremendous opportunities for innovation and progress that it presents.
