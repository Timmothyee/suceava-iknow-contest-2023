# suceava-iknow-contest-2023
This was the code I used for a contest called iKnow from the university in my city. We were tasked to scan a 10-page-long string of text for different questions, which are listed in the README file

Now, the code might not be so organized, optimized, or working correctly, but we only had about 2 hours and I haven't corrected the code since then

The tasks included:
-letter count
-word count
-how many times the letter a appears
-how many times a bunch of words in a list appear in the text
-find the sentence with all the letters of the alphabet present in it
-the most used word
-on which position does a word appear 
-biggest number in the text
-smallest number in the text
-the sum of all the numbers

Then analizing some given lists, biggest, smallest number, display all the numbers in the list, unique elements, non-unique elements, duplicates and so on
And transforming the Roman MMMCMXCIX to arabic (3999)
